Routing protocols have been tested by considering a graph like network of routers. The goal is to find the shortest path from the source to the destination.


The two protocols here are AODV and djikstra.
* Each python code calculates the path to the destination. 
* The time taken to do the same is written to a file
* The average time taken to do n iterations is calculated
* graph.py creates a graph based on the same. This is done to determine a better algorithm.
